Gittip: https://www.gittip.com/Greduan/

Simply download the files of the Gist that corresponds to the ID you give it.


Installation
------------

You can get the latest stable and/or development version from the GitHub
repo. <https://github.com/Greduan/download-gist>

To install simply clone this repo somewhere, install npm packages `npm install`
and add an alias to your shell that points to the location of this repo's
`bin/dg`.  Something like this:

    alias cmi='/home/greduan/dev/download-gist/bin/dg'

Of course replacing that with your actual location.  Can be an absolute path or
not, your preference, but I'm not exactly sure what would and wouldn't work for
this, so figure it out.
