# News (Changelog for users)

All changes that would affect users will be listed in this file.

## v0.4.0 - 2014-12-03

Re-write happened.  No longer depends on Chainy because they were too many
dependencies and also very big dependencies.

## v0.1.0 to v0.3.0

Previous versions. No incompatible change but the code was re-written so these
versions don't matter. They also don't matter because this is a tiny app, not a
library of any sort.
